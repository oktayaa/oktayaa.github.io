Be nice if there were an email address here, I know. But it's not 1995 anymore and we can't be trusted with good things.

In the absence of email, here's what can happen.

If for whatever reason you feel compelled to contact me, you can do so on github. I am leaving the issues section open for the repository where this site lives. You can reach it at **[my github issue tracker](https://github.com/oktayaa/oktayaa.github.io/issues)** .

If you have a correction or comment, please don't forget to mention the url of the article it belongs to. I will credit you when I make a correction or incorporate your valuable comment. You can specify whether you want to be credited by name, url, email etc.
